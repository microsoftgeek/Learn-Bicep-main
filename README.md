## Introduction

This project is created to test Bicep language features, compilation, validations, etc.

Learning by examples is a main focus and accomplished through writing simple and helpful Azure infrastructure code with Bicep language.


The followings are initial goals of the project:

    - Automate deployment via GitHub Actions
    - Author Infrastructure as a Code (IaC)
    - Author Security as Code (SaC)
    - Showcase new features of Azure Bicep as they come

  - [Run sample demos](#Run-sample-demos)
  - [Workflows](#Workflows)
  - [Project Layout](#Project-Layout)

## How to run sample demos
Get running your samples in the VS Code:
- Fork the branch (aka, starting from obvious ;)
- Install Azure CLI or PowerShell Core on you machine
- Enable the Bicep runtime on you machine: try 'az bicep version' or 'bicep version'
- Install VS Code Bicep extension

## Workflows
- SL Scan: shiftleft-analysis:-> describes workflow purpose
- Deploy-Main-Site: main.deployment:-> describes workflow purpose

## Project Layout
- modules: contain reusable components
- param-files: Learn about parameterization options in Azure Bicep files
- samples: contain 11 step deployments of Azure and security services
- scripts: contain single '.azcli' file that walk you through deployment scripts
